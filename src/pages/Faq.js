                                <p>SURPRISE stands for non-fungible tokens such as ERC-721 (a smart contract standard) tokens that are hosted on Ethereumâ€™s own blockchain. SURPRISEs are unique digital items similar to collectibles, artwork or game items. As an artist, by tokenizing your work you both ensure that it remains unique and brand it as your own. The actual ownership is blockchain-managed.</p>
